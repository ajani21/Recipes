### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

Inluded screenshots in the Resources folder:
1. Has a collapsable view for cusine specific to each country
2. The countries are alphabetically listed as well as the dishes in each drop down
3. The error states are handled with different UIs
4. Has card arts for each of recipe with image, name, and link to see the recipe
5. Created an app icon on canva

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I chose to focus on 3 main things user experience, code architecture, and testing. 

For user experience, I chose to use collapsible sections for organization. Also, I decided that keeping all dropdowns closed to start with will help the customer browse all the countries. This will help with their selection process. The card art has been left simple intentionally which drawn more attention to the images themselves, whihc will cause customers to open the link and make for themselves.

For code architecture, I chose to use MVVM for clean code and separation of concerns. I also implemented dependency injection for seamless testability since it gives flexibility to other data. I also created protocols for network layer abstraction.

For testing, wrote unit testing for the core functions, created mock services for reliable testing, and tested both the success and failure cases.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

Initial setup and basic functionality: 1.25 hours
UI implementation and refinement: 2 hours
Testing and bug fixes: 1 hours
Documentation + README: .75 hours

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
During initial setup, I loaded all the card just load on the screen without a collapsible view. Then, I made the decision to go with a better strucutred UI. I did not have any major trade offs. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think my UI could have had more color, maybe some fun animations? Definitely could have messed around with that more. I just did not have as much time since I restricted myself to 4-5 hours based on the interview doc recommendation.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Nothing else to share, I had a blast making the app :)
